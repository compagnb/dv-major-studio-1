when your surfing with mates and theres some barrels i get more excited then anyone looking into a barrel when one of your mates eats shit is just the best thing its almost more fun being looking into it then being in there because your just like aww yeahhh and if they eat it you're just like yes this is one of my favorite things i love it i surf because there is nothing better then getting crazy barrels with your mates i surf because its the only place that i can take whats in my head and perform it i surf because when you take off on a wave you can pretty much do anything you like when i was young and when i surfed i surfed because kelly slater did it i surfed because it was hyped i surfed because i got chicks i surfed because it was the party i surfed cuz i got the cool car and uh i got all those cool things and it all became uh just stuff its all about the feeling i get from riding that wave that first wave is the reason why i think everyone just keeps going back its like anything if you didn't like it the first time you're not going to go back and do it again like i tried ice skating and i ate it and i didn't go back again ever that wasn't for me ice skating was out surfing if you could catch a wave your hooked right then and there i have a lot of inner demons if i didn't have surfing to get those out of my system i would self destruct surfing's the only reason that keeps me going in a normal state keeps my life at an even keel without it it will just tip into oblivion for a bit of surfing i swear ill be honest i wasn't having fun i was going out putting a jersey on doing what i was supposed to do and it was just repetition i literally just lost my will to compete i wouldn't be doing it right now if i didn't have the will i mean its not as strong as it used to be but i know its growing the whole reason i started i lost so many heats to get to where i was i lost to a girl my first contest ever and i quit for a year and never touched a jersey and i had to pick up the jersey after that and get back in there and thats the only reason i got to where i am at or was at 5 years ago and won the title and you know i haven't won a title in a long time but i'm getting back in the jersey and i'm not winning heats yet i gotta start somewhere the first wave i ever caught i remember it to this day clear as day i went left  left and the wave never broke and i thought right then this is the coolest thing in the world and from that day on i told my dad every night i wanna go surfing i wanna go surfing i wanna go surfing i wanna go surfing all started with going left right left on one wave at the pier and i literally will never forget that wave til the day i die i was like one of those purest moments of my whole life and it always will be i surf because i'm always a better person when i come in try and explain color to a blind person and try and explain surfing to a person who's never surfed it's very similar its like you can talk for ah days but you probably won't hit the mark the inability to describe something to me is proof that it is fucking amazing its that amazing is good enough for me i'm happy to not know i'm happy to not understand whats going on i don't need to understand it all you surf because you really really want to and because you're loving it and it's a blessing or you don't surf i've been gifted the opportunity to not have to go to a 9 to 5 job and to not have to be in that mindset so i figure why not go as far the other way as i could the great thing is theres no rules with surfing you don't have to surf til the day you die one day you might just wake up and be done ya just surf because it feels good and surf cuz ya can and thats how i feel about myself i always drink a little bit of the water when i get into the ocean before i start catching waves i'll drink it so like a little bit of what i'm in is in me it just feels good to feel that there's something of whats all around me inside me and my body will understand where i'm at and what i'm doing a little better if its on the inside and the outside tom robbins said is that art it is meaningless in a way it has no purpose but our lives without it would be meaningless and without purpose and for me surfing is the same where you pull of it in the waves and there's nothing in your hands there's nothing to hold there's nothing to show there's nothing to eat its just the feeling the experience the more loose i get in the surfing experience the more interest there is the more fun i have and just the more vibrancy and richness in life seems to come from that so i'm just thinking why not just go to the ends to agree with that why not go to the periphery i surf because its a blessing and i feel blessed to even have that choice i surf because i always believe there is something better in the next wave ya know there's a better line better angle there's a deeper barrel theres a carrot that dangles in front of me to be better everyones gonna paddle back out for the next wave put themselves deeper put themselves in a better position to push themselves to push themselves to the limit for their reward even for me when i feel like i'm doing my best surfing it feels like i work hard it feels easy to do it i can remember riding my first board that my dad gave to me and i remember when i got barreled and then i though i was in it and i just got the chhhaaa i got the lip on the head and i came in and hes like what ya gotta do is like look at the lip look where the lip comes from thats the key to riding the barrel it opened my world up and i was like i can see the thing where its coming from now and i knew how to barrel and it was like still to this day probably one of my best surf memories i think i will always treasure an event win more then an epic surf when i sit in the water i always think theres still a chance i'm still gonna win its pipe ya know set get in the right position when you gotta so you know i always have that feeling when its not over its not over until its over once it was over i just i needed to get out of there it felt like the whole world was watching me it just felt like i needed to get to somewhere it was just me on my own just try to hog by my image away and punched a couple walls threw my board took my shower and bawled my eyes out just crying and it was just like ahhh this is just it cant be it cant be i got up and walked outside and was just like if i don't face the world now i never will so it couldn't get any worse ya know even if i got dead last this year its never gonna be as bad as what happened last year i've done the hard yards there's only one way to put it out and thats to win one i surf because my dad pushed me into a wave and i was 3 years old and i haven't been able to stop since you boys ask me wheres your favorite wave like where ever i can catch one it makes me very happy to surf to be in the water to be a part of all that rhythm and uh and just that outside feeling you have when ya in the big blue ocean its just an amazing feeling i surf because it keeps me alive i think its uh one of the most crucial in my life that i do its definitely given me everything that i have in my life and its showing me everything that i've been able to learn ya know with traveling and meeting people different countries different cultures that i've been apart of and and then i just think that uh there's nothing like surfing you know i've seen people at their greatest moments and also i've pushed my son in the waves i have a 7 year old and a 3 year old their my 2 little boys and i remember the first time that he ever caught a wave and he looked back at me you know and he had the same reaction on his face as if he just one the world title or something you know its like that feeling you get when you riding a wave its like theres a moment there you you actually realize somethings special beyond belief is happening because the thing that you're riding will never break like that again and grips would have been an inland area where not very many people surf and ah all my other friends would be going to like football practice baseball soccer and my parents would be driving me out to the beach and uh thank god they did ive always been addicted to just surfing thats all i'd wanna do surfing is like alotta elements of like mother nature and everything that happens to occur that day with weather and tide and so when a moment when that all comes together and you get that perfect wave you kinda feel like on top of the world for more then just that moment you know it carries with you sometimes for the rest of your life get the same feeling when playing music that i do surfing but not completely different feel but its like i feel like i'm creating you know creating stuff it's forever changing you know i use like a million different ways you can view the chords or the progressions or the rhythm same with surfing and the waves and stuff you think maybe like today can i write a song today am i gonna go get barreled or its always exciting i surf because i always have i always will
