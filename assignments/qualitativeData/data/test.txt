Surfers only ride a wave for an average time of six seconds, and the waves of their lives only happen from time to time. But in this sport, it's rare to meet someone who quit surfing because he or she didn't enjoy the feeling of walking on water. Surfers have more fair surf sessions on average than they do epic moments in crystal clear waves. The best rides of their lives come along only once in a while. So, despite onshore surfing days, one foot waves, cold water and choppy waters, surfers always return to the scene of the crime. Why is surfing so addictive? Is it any different from other sports, such as soccer, running, swimming or tennis? Surfing is highly addictive. It's one of the most popular board sports ever invented. There are over 20 million surfers in the world, and the number is growing fast. Each surfer will have his or her own list of reasons they are drawn so irresistibly to the sport, but accounting for commonality, here are, 25 very good reasons why surfing is so addictive: Riding a wave is a breathless experience Adrenaline injections pump our heart and blood Sun, salt and sand are a virtuous blend Oceans have a positive impact on human health The best way to forget your daily problems is to face bigger challenges In the lineup, you're alone with everybody Every wave has a different feeling As you progress, you're compelled to surf better each day There are waves in every corner of the world It's a great way of living life A beer tastes better after a surf session Personal surfing photos are inestimable Only a surfer knows the feeling There's a deep sense of connection with the cultural history of surfing through time There's always the next surfboard to be bought Surfing makes you feel alive The first wave ride is unforgettable Weather forecasts are never 100% accurate, adding to thrill Humans love water Each ridden wave is a personal story Gods seem to be around during the best waves of your life Wax smells nice Surfboards are objects of design and desire The drive to exploring and discover new surf spots intensifies with time For many, the concept of chasing waves up and down the coast, or ultimately around the world, checking forecasts, putting on and taking off a tight unflattering neoprene onesie, and then sitting in the ocean waiting for waves may seem like an absurd idea, let alone fun. For the few but rapidly growing members of the population, this concept seems like the only reasonable way to live life. For us, the salty ocean, burny red eyes, dry crusty hair, burnt faces and sore shoulders is the most satisfying feeling. For ages, people who don’t surf or have any affiliation with the ocean ask , ‘Why do you do it?’. This is my attempt to answer that question: It’s Fun This may seem obvious. But isn’t this a goal for everyone on a daily basis? To have fun? Especially if you can do it through something that you love. Even when there is no swell, I still love to be in the ocean whether it’s snorkeling, paddling or body surfing, as long as I get my dose of the ocean I’m having fun. And I’m happy.

You are literally riding the Earth’s energy in it’s most raw and natural form. The water molecules that are beneath you have traveled millions of kilometers across the surface of the Earth and you are the lucky one that gets to ride that particular wave and feel it’s energy beneath your very own feet. Pretty amazing if you ask me! Every Wave Is Different No wave is exactly the same. Each time that we ride a wave, there are different water molecules that are part of it’s make-up that is different to the last one, even though they might have looked the same. It never forms exactly like the last one, it’s smaller, bigger, thicker or shaped completely differently.
