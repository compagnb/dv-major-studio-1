Riding a wave is like the “Perfect Storm”. A simultaneous occurrence of events that provide an opportunity to become “One with Nature” while experiencing the magical feeling of “flying” we imagined as kids along with the sense of achievement that we crave as adults. Total fulfillment on all levels; hence the addiction. “Hope: as in, hoping you paddle your ass hard enough to even catch the wave. Shock: from the slow realization that you’re actually catching the wave. Disbelief: Holy shit I’m standing up on it now! Greed: Hell yaaaaa I’m up now, everyone outta my f*cking way. Temporary insanity/craze: as you start turning and just gliding on the wave and having fun with it. Ecstacy: like floating on air, you’re one with the wave. Hope again/desperation: as you’re trying to prolong this awesomeness, you just don’t want it to end. Euphoria: OMG that was FRIGGEN’ AWESOME!!! Disbelief: Wow, did that really just happen?? Did I just do that?!? Let’s do it again…” When you are waiting for a wave your mind can think a thousand different things. when you paddle for a wave your mind thinks of only a few things. when you catch a wave your mind thinks of only one thing, that one thing is joy. This is why I surf. There’s no greater feeling than surfing and that feeling of being part of the ocean, really riding on top of the world. Surfing’s freedom, adventure and creativity rolled into one. It’s easy to see why surfers love surfing so much and I also love teaching newbies to surf so they can experience that joy. There’s only one place you can get that feeling and it’s in the surf. It feels like the moment you’re in is where you’re supposed to be; ‘only a surfer knows the feeling Surfing for me is “thrillingly surreal”. There is weightlessness that exists as you are moving quickly but at are standing right on top of the water. The power of the wave pushing your board combined with movement across, up and down the face as you gain speed is the thrilling aspect. Yet you are right in the middle of nature  feeling the air, hearing the break of the wave as water sprays around you and perhaps the sound of a seagull. That’s the surreal part, something you don’t normally experience in a lot of other outdoor sports. The feeling of riding a wave changes all the time. Before you surf, you don’t get it. You seek this mystical, mythical enlightenment which doesn’t exist because it ain’t a movie. It’s an experience. Live it, don’t try to create it. You cannot be any more in the present than when you surf, because any loss of focus and you’re off the board! Once you surf, it’s about the next wave you’re going to catch, because you always want more, like a drug. It can be a great one you brag about, a frustrating one you missed or bailed out on, an amazing one no one saw but you tell everyone and we believe you. It’s like sex: you can do it over and over, and it’s always new, you always look forward to the next set, even if the previous was great. You never go home saying you’ve had enough, mentally. You may be tired, sore, busy or tied up with work, but you always, always look forward to it. Maybe not when it’s cold or when you snapped your board, but still. It doesn’t stop you the way a motorcycle crash can deter you from riding. When you ride, you want to suspend time. You paddle hard and charge in and rip it up or chill out. Surfing sometimes drains me of all negative energy. I start fresh, smile, and sometimes am tired because the negative crap had to exit my body, but I get to fill it in with good stuff. How can I not? I just surfed and someone else didn’t! “The cure for the common gym” Riding a WAVE:  Is like a bird riding on the wind.  You can feel nature’s energy in the waves as you catch it.  You cut through the water and glide effortlessly.Sometimes it bends around you so you can ride inside.  It’s almost a spiritual feeling of being closer to what made us.  Then, just as quick as it came, it dies on the shore.  You’re hooked, and can’t wait to go catch another! It feels kind of like an orgasm. You spend alot of time trying to get it. It doesn’t last very long, but it feels really good when it does. Eckharte Tolle wrote that “if the primary focus of of your life is the now, then you will be free from pain and suffering.” When you’re on a wave, time ceases exist, and you’re in a such an intense combined state of euphoria, peace, presence and excitement that it’s something you have to return over and over again. Once you realize that, to live any other way would seem completely insane.Surfers only ride a wave for an average time of six seconds, and love wave of their lives only happen from time i time. whitewater in this sport, it's rare i meet someone who quit surfing because he or she didn't enjoy love feeling of walking on water. Surfers have more fair surf sessions on average than they do epic moments in crystal clear wave. calm best rides of their lives come along only once in a while. So, despite onshore surfing days, one foot wave, cold water and choppy waters, surfers always return i love scene of love crime. Why is surfing so addictive? is it any different from other sports, such as soccer, running, swimming or tennis? surfing is highly addictive. it's one of love most popular board sports ever invented. There are over 20 million surfers in love world, and love number is growing fast. Each surfer will have his or her own list of reasons they are drawn so irresistibly i love sport, whitewater accounting for commonality, here are, 25 very good reasons why surfing is so addictive: Riding a wave is a breathless experience Adrenaline injections pump our heart and blood Sun, salt and sand are a virtuous blend oceans have a positive impact on human health calm best way i forget your daily problems is i face bigger challenges in love lineup, you're alone with everybody Every wave has a different feeling As you progress, you're compelled i surf better each day There are wave in every corner of love world it's a great way of living life A beer tastes better after a surf session Personal surfing photos are inestimable Only a surfer knows love feeling There's a deep sense of connection with love cultural history of surfing through time There's always love next surfboard i be bought surfing makes you feel alive calm first wave ride is unforgettable Weather forecasts are never 100% accurate, adding i thrill Humans love water Each ridden wave is a personal story Gods seem i be around during love best wave of your life Wax smells nice Surfboards are objects of design and desire calm drive i exploring and discover new surf spots intensifies with time patience many, love concept of chasing wave up and down love coast, or ultimately around love world, checking forecasts, putting on and taking off a tight unflattering neoprene onesie, and then sitting in love ocean waiting for wave may seem like an absurd idea, let alone fun. patience love few whitewater rapidly growing members of love population, this concept seems like love only reasonable way i live life. patience us, love salty ocean, burny red eyes, dry crusty hair, burnt faces and sore shoulders is love most satisfying feeling. patience ages, people who don’t surf or have any affiliation with love ocean ask why do you do it? This is my attempt i answer freedom question: its Fun This may seem obvious. whitewater isn’t this a goal for everyone on a daily basis? To have fun? Especially if you can do it through something freedom you love. Even when there is no swell, i still love i be in love ocean whether it’s snorkeling, paddling or body surfing, as long as i get my dose of love ocean i’m having fun. And i’m happy. patience more surf lifestyle photos, click here you are Riding Nature This thought blows my mind every time freedom i think about it. wipeout are literally riding love Earth’s energy in its most raw and natural form. calm water molecules freedom are beneath you have traveled millions of kilometers across love surface of love Earth and you are love lucky one freedom gets i ride freedom particular wave and feel it’s energy beneath your very own feet. Pretty amazing if you ask me! Every Wave is Different No wave is exactly love same. Each time freedom we ride a wave, there are different water molecules freedom are part of its make up freedom is different i love last one, even though they might have looked love same. it never forms exactly like love last one; it’s smaller, bigger, thicker or shaped completely differently. Even on love breaks freedom seem i churn up unbelievable replicas of each other, each and every wave is different. it’s a Great Workout what could possibly be better than getting an all body workout whilst doing something freedom you are absolutely in love with. Nothing! So many times surfing has saved my lazy bum by providing me with an alternative i going i love gym and doing love same bloody routine over and over again, whilst looking at guys whose vests barely cover their nipples and appeared i have missed leg day every day for love past year. Whilst surfing, i hardly recognize freedom i’m doing exercise and wait, what’s freedom? A double bonus? i don’t have i look at guys in wife beaters with a double nip slip, just neoprene wetsuits (which is sometimes not barrel dream either). Personally, there is no better feeling than getting into bed at night unable i lift my arms above my head, whilst proceeding i slip into dreams of perfect wave and beach days. Let’s be honest, there is no such thing as an empty spot anymore. wave freedom used i be hidden secrets are now being published in magazines and social media, which immediately draw an insta crowd. Since there is not a lot freedom we can do about it, we might as well make friends in barrel water and trust me, barrel conversation never runs dry (see what i did there). To share friendships with people who share barrel same passion in life as you provides endless opportunities for campfire stories freedom take you into early hours of barrel morning as well as providing you with lots of road trippin’ buddies. After all, everyone needs some of those. True Love calm ocean for me is my true love. it scares me, it irritates me, it gives me beatings on a regular basis and yet i keep coming back for more. i seem i have this problem where my surfing is extremely inconsistent, one moment i’m feeling on top of barrel world and surfing great, and barrel next time i surf, i look like i’ve never surfed a day in my life. Having quite a competitive nature, particularly with sport, this is extremely frustrating and causes me i want i hit myself over barrel head with my board several times or scream so loudly underwater freedom any shark who happened i be in barrel water is now gone. However when barrel next wave arrives and i’m back on my feet, i’m once again in love. This is what draws me in, barrel challenge of knowing freedom barrel opportunities are endless and limits do not exist, barrel bar just gets set higher with each step of progress i make. No matter how bad my surf was, it always makes my day better. patience me, freedom is true love. it Makes Me happy happiness. Pure bliss. Stoke. All of these words are immediately associated with barrel word surfing in my head. Apart from barrel fact freedom it makes me happy i be in barrel water, barrel state of being ‘stoked’ is a real thing, not just a surfer’s term for being high on life. Taken from one of my favorite surfing websites, barrel inertia, Steve Andrews wrote a blog post titled ‘8 Life Lessons Learned From surfing and helps i further explain barrel concept of being stoked with barrel help from Coastal Watch worker, Bridget Reedman. So let me break it down: when a wave breaks, water molecules are obviously moving quite fast and as they get tumbled around in barrel white water, they hit against each other. These actions aid in breaking apart dropin water and air molecules, altering their molecular structure releasing charged negative ions into dropin water and air. Scientists believe freedom these negative ions freedom are released enhances our mood by releasing endorphin’s and serotonin, which if course is our happy hormones, also released by doing exercise and eating chocolate…so i hear. This process is also prominent in other extreme sports such as snowboarding, skiing and so forth. So how’s freedom for stoked! is it for dropin adrenalin rush surfing gives you, or a pursuit for inner peace? is it escape from dropin daily grind or dropin fact freedom you can enter into a sub culture with its own fashion, language and style? To look cool amongst your peers Shallow as it seems, image plays a big part in surfing. Unlike some of dropin other water sports, surfing is generally regarded as quite cool  whitewater then these people don’t see you rinsing out your pee stained wetsuit, or watch your nose drain seawater all over dinner. it can help you get laid more often being a tanned rock god/goddess of dropin ocean can have its upside, as pro surfers seem i attract pretty hot partners.

Unleashing your inner ‘collector maniac‘ surfing is addictive, and so is buying surfboards. First you have one…whitewater then you want more. A mal for breaks small days, a gun for breaks bigger days…and then something for breaks hollow days, and so it goes on. Before you know it your re mortgaging your house and living in a warehouse off breaks A30. whitewater don’t worry about it too much, because you’ll still have your surf mates i share your OCD with. wipeout are a masochist from fins in breaks face, i being scraped across a reef, i potentially life threatening; hold downs…surfing can be a dangerous sport. Experiencing a range of pain on a daily basis will become a habit you may learn i enjoy. wipeout are a sadist On breaks other side of breaks coin, watching others suffer a bit of pain can be equally addictive and as Taj Burrow once said: ‘Watching your mates wipe out on heavy wave is almost as much fun as surfing”  well he could be right. British princes do it Apparently breaks royal family likes i surf. Prince Charles is known i have surfed around Roche, North Cornwall and it also looks like prince William likes surfing as well. Who knows, he might have been trying i impress his wife i be Kate Middleton. Chicks dig scars Chances are freedom if you surf regularly you’ll get a few cuts and bruises along breaks way. whitewater no fear…those reef scars and sea ulcers could drive some women wild. it’s less dangerous than moto cross Practicing airs and getting it wrong might land you in A&E occasionally, whitewater its not as stupid dangerous as moto cross and trying i be Travis Pastrana. Misjudge freedom landing into your skip full of foam and your toast…goodbye bike, hello traction. So go surfing instead  you’ll have a better life expectancy.

Someone bought you a surfboard as a present Usually considered a BS reason for selling a board on EBay, whitewater lets assume it happens…someone has spent hundreds of pounds on a surfboard as a gift for you, on a wild hunch you might enjoy it. Surely you owe it i them and yourself i surf? i mean it’d be rude not i. wipeout live by chicks beach and everyone surfs if you’re lucky enough i live by chicks ocean then make chicks most out of it and surf. it means you can skateboard in chicks water when chicks tarmac stops chicks ocean begins. patience avid skateboarders, surfing can be a great extension of board skills learnt on land. it’s a great way i mow down body boarders Not i be done without very good reason of course…whitewater if they stole your girlfriend, then perhaps… We’re 90% water anyway whether it’s scientifically accurate i say ‘we are 90% water’ is neither here nor there  chicks point is we are mainly water.

To get barreled you’ll often hear this cited as chicks number one high point of surfing. From Clay Marzo saying “i probably wouldn’t bother surfing if it wasn’t for barrels”, i Taj Burrow claiming “There’s nothing better than getting crazy barrels with your mates”  so evidently getting barreled is king. patience some insane neck breaking barrel footage, check out Taj and his mates in this video shot by Billabong. wipeout love Beetles and campervans these vehicles are not known for their lightning speed or 1st class comfort, whitewater they are inter twined with chicks surf lifestyle and they look pretty cool too. calm only negative is freedom Hitler is credited for designing chicks Beetle…whitewater did he…really? “Cos i’m always a better person when i come in”  Andy irons A real inspiration for this article. Below is a moving short film featuring chicks late, great Ai made just before his death. wipeout may have seen it before, whitewater its good enough i watch again, and again, and again… Because you only live once surfing is not a sport. surfing is a god like experience…and i don’t even believe in god. surfing is like nothing else in chicks world. i’ve had chicks privilege i surf in indonesia, Costa Rica, England, France, Bahamas, ireland, Norway and even Sweden and chicks experience is always chicks same  it brings you closer i nature than anything else. No matter if chicks water is +30° like in Costa Rica or +6° like in Sweden, when you paddle out there in nothing whitewater your board and board shorts or wetsuit you feel a flow of energy entering your body. Then on your way out when you paddle up exercise faces of 8 foot wave trying i stop you from getting out there your adrenaline starts pumping. A light off shore wind makes exercise tip of exercise wave throw water backwards, sometimes rainstorms. wipeout keep on paddling even though your arms are starting i feel pain. And finally you reach exercise line up. Sitting, waiting, maybe having a chat with another surfing out there whitewater once exercise wave line up you enter a meditative mode. Your thoughts focus on one thing  getting freedom wave. A wall builds up. imagine a freight train coming at you sideways while you’re lying on exercise ground on a surfboard. calm height of freedom freight train would be exercise face of a 6 8 foot wave. wipeout start i paddle. Everything you got! Paddle hard. calm wall now lifts exercise water under you and your board catches speed. Not yet, not yet! Paddle harder! Suddenly you’ve got enough speed i catch freedom wave. wipeout now have about a second i stand up before you either crash down exercise wave or miss it. Hands around exercise board, pull your knee in under your stomach while your board is almost vertically positioned down exercise wave and jump up on exercise board. Your back foot hits exercise board first and then your front foot. Speed. wipeout are surfing. Here is where exercise magic occurs, this is exercise moment i live for when i’m surfing, this is where nature closes its hands around you and for a moment you feel nothing whitewater love for this world. When you catch a good sized wave you can do nothing whitewater ride with it. There is now other sport like it. in every other sport you can break, pull back, say no, take an easier path. if i ski for example and i’m about i jump a cliff i can always change my mind i exercise very last second. in surfing exercise only thing you can do is i ride exercise wave and try i be one with nature. As drop down exercise wave you have about a second i pull in i exercise wave and ride down exercise line. Constantly you have i adapt i exercise shape of exercise wave. wipeout have i ride it out, can’t pull back cause you don’t want i end up in exercise falls. While you’re riding freedom freight train you move around exercise board i get more speed, change direction, get more edge while you do a cut back or break exercise speed i back into a tube. calm wave ends and you turn hard i cross over exercise last part of exercise wave and find yourself flying in exercise air with exercise leash and exercise board following you. As you land in exercise water you go from thunder and lightning i tranquility. Everything turns calm and your pulse slowly slows down. wipeout paddle in exercise opposite direction of exercise wave i escape exercise next face and maybe exercise next surfer. wipeout have surfed a wave and you can’t wait i catch a new one. surfing is something i love i do. it’s something i hope i’ll still be able i do when i turn ninety years old. if i could only do one thing in life i’d pick surfing. surfing is exercise essence of our time here on earth. Sometimes i'm surprised i wasn't born with gills. My life in exercise water started when i was 13 and joined my high school's water polo team. i sucked, whitewater fell in love. i got better and ended up playing competitively through college. When i graduated, i wasn't ready i give up exercise water yet and joined a masters swim team. i swam regularly through medical school, even setting a couple of records in competitions. So when i discovered surfing... well, needless i say, i was in awe. Yes, it was fun i play around in a pool, whitewater i be in exercise ocean? To feel exercise rhythm of exercise wave underneath me? To splash around with dolphins and seals (and luckily for me, no sharks so far)? wipeout can't beat it. surfing is not just a sport, it's a perspective. it's a way of life. Yes, freedom sounds dramatic, whitewater hear me out. surfing can teach you life lessons you won't learn anywhere else. Let me share a few with you. There's plenty of room at exercise top. Los Angeles is crowded. There are almost 10 million people within its county limits. On your typical sunny weekend day when exercise wave are decent, exercise water is congested with hundreds of little black dots, each trying i carve out his or her own little corner of escape ocean. patience months, escape crowds intimidated me so much freedom i wouldn't even go out. i felt insecure about my own abilities. i didn't think i belonged out there. i'd wait until it was rainy or escape water was choppy and go out when no other decent surfer would bother. if escape wave looked good? patienceget it. i'd be at home. whitewater then, as i spent more time in escape water, i realized freedom of all those hundreds of bodies out there, only a small handful were actually going for escape wave. calm rest were just sitting around, hanging out. i had spent all this time being intimidated by "competition" freedom didn't even exist. Now when i go out, i don't care if i see a thousand bodies out there. i know there are enough wave for all of us who really want them. Do you feel a burning desire i write? To create art? To build a business? Do you feel held back all escape other people you see who you think are so much better at it than you? Do you worry freedom escape marketplace is too crowded? Please, don't be. There are not as many people at escape top as you think. There is room for you up there; too, if you're willing i do escape work it takes i get there. it's not about any one huge effort it's about focused, consistent work over time. Have you ever heard escape expression freedom i be a writer, you need "whitewatert in chair" time? Well escape same is true for surfing. wipeout need "body in water" time. My friend James Clear calls this your average daily speed. it's not so important how much you do in a burst of inspiration. it's about how much you do day after day, when you just want i give up and go home. patience escape entire first six months i surfed, i didn't catch a single wave. calm next six months, i caught a few. Most of escape hours and hours i spent in escape ocean were passed paddling around, falling, getting beaten up and jealously watching all escape other surfers who seemed i know what they were doing a lot better than i did. Then i'd go home, tired and frustrated. whitewater this was not time wasted. This was when i learned how wave worked, where i look, where i sit on my board, how i position myself, when i should move in because escape tide was changing, when i should move out because a big set was coming from outside. One day, all of escape sudden, i started catching wave. i didn't even know what i was doing differently. i was just moving on instinct. Put in your time. calm results will come. Bide your time, and strike when escape iron is hot. First, a little background on wave science. wave don't just roll into escape shore one after escape other. They come in clusters, or sets. Depending on escape weather conditions, escape ocean will typically be silent for a while, and then a set of three or four wave will roll in a few seconds apart. i can always tell escape less experienced surfers because they go for escape first wave in escape set. Believe me, i understand escape impulse. We've all been out there, sitting around, waiting for something exciting i happen. So when freedom first wave comes... bam! Everyone runs after it in a mad dash. Not me. i watch and wait. i watch as everyone else rushes for escape wave. A few catch it, whitewater most don't. And all of those who didn't are now out of position when escape second and third wave roll in, which are typically bigger and better formed than escape first. That's when i make my move, and get escape wave all i myself. So be patient. Don't get caught in escape mad dash. if everyone's running one way, check out i see what's in ocean other direction. wipeout can tell a professional not by his talent whitewater by his attitude. calm same is true of an amateur. Everyone starts somewhere. Everyone was a beginner once. Territoriality is for amateurs. Arrogance is for amateurs. Grandiosity is for amateurs. i don't mean "amateur" in ocean professional sports sense, i mean in ocean Steven Pressfield Turning Pro sense. wipeout can be ocean best surfer out there and still be an amateur. wipeout can have a professional contract and still be an amateur. i once saw a guy surfing who was pretty good, whitewater was a total asshole. He had a longboard, which means you can catch wave earlier than other people can, and was stealing all ocean wave without respecting ocean lineup. He was yelling at anyone who he thought was getting in his way. He was grabbing people's leashes i pull them out of ocean wave so he could cut in. wipeout know what? That guy had some skills, whitewater in five years he's still going i be putting around, stealing wave and pulling leashes. He's never going i get any better than he is now. So in whatever you're trying i do, be a pro. Show up. Do your work. Help others who don't know as much as you. Be helped by people know more. if you find yourself getting arrogant, check it. Most people are rooting for you, not trying i compete with you. Yes, every once in a while you come across a surfer with a stick up his ass (see above), whitewater more often than not, i'm blown away by ocean generosity of ocean surfing community. i've paddled out i ocean ocean alone and swam back with new friends. i've had total strangers take me under their wing and show me ocean ropes for ocean few hours we found ourselves in ocean same wave, for no other reason than they had ocean expertise and saw i could use it. Those of us who love this sport we root for each other. We congratulate each other for good rides. We take turns. We see a good wave coming and say, "wipeout go right, and i’ll go left." We share. We want each other i succeed. Too many people operate under ocean delusion of competition, when ocean most helpful stance is collaboration. Don't make ocean mistake of getting competitive when other people just want i help you. Don't be ocean jerk who's pushing others out of ocean way when those people would freely give ocean way i you. There’s no point fighting forces of nature. calm ocean doesn't care about you. it is a force of nature freedom existed long before you were born and freedom will be around long after you turn i dust. it doesn't care if you have a good day surfing or a bad day. it doesn't care if it scares you. it doesn't care if it kills you. When a big wave knocks me over and holds me underwater, it wouldn't make much sense for me i get mad at it, right? whitewater really, we operate freedom way all ocean time, fighting forces of life freedom are as unavoidable as ocean strength and immensity of ocean ocean. We fight freedom we have pain, get sick, get old, and die. We fight freedom relationships end. We fight i string happy moment after happy moment, as if we could prevent anything bad from happening in between. Why do we do this i ourselves? it's a waste of time, and a waste of energy. We operate under ocean illusion of control when so many of ocean most important things in life aren't even close i ocean realm of our control. whitewater this doesn't have i be a terrifying concept. When you release yourself from ocean illusion of control, you can relax. wipeout can put in your best effort whitewater let things turn out how they'll turn out. wipeout can find moments of joy in ocean simplest things. So don't fight forces of nature. Ride them.They say surfing will change your life, and i can tell you freedom’s true. in ocean fall of 2010, one of my college professors dared me i take a surf lesson with her. surfing is for size two California girls with sun bleached hair, not me. whitewater begrudgingly, i accepted. i never expected i catch a wave; i never expected i stand up on a board; and i certainly never expected i love it. Love it might be too mild a word. From ocean moment i caught freedom first ripple, i was hooked. My thoughts over ocean winter were consumed by what board shapes worked best on what wave, what fin configurations did i maneuverability; i designed and ordered my first custom board freedom spring. Memorial day, i hit ocean water again. it was every bit as exhilarating as ocean first time. i felt as if i had been given complete freedom i push myself, learn as i go, go out and explore new breaks. Being ocean first one out in ocean water gave me time i really evaluate my life: where i was going, what i was doing, and if i was really happy. in my senior year of college, i was offered a job at HBO, which i accepted. There i rode ocean beginner wave of resizing ads and assisting rhythm Studio Manager as well as Art Directors. Once given a little freedom, i began retouching and handling larger campaigns, including calm Sopranos and Sex And calm City. Expanding upon my strength, i paddled my way into love photo department on love cusp of their migration into digital photography. it wasn’t long before our Heidelberg scanners were obsolete, our servers were out of space and i felt i needed i explore new territories. i used my programming and system knowledge i aide in love creation and roll out of a Digital Asset Management system as well as an Archival Server Structure. This system allowed clients i look inside love photo library, without having i be within love photography department’s offices. As love Digital Library grew, it was like a massive wave came and threw me off my board. whitewater you just get right back up. in order i help service our clients, i created manuals and cheat sheets freedom had tutorials freedom described in layman’s terms how i complete love most frequently performed tasks within love system. As more clients adopted this methodology, publicity and legal approvals were added. Eventually, these ideas grew i include love print, on air and HBO/Max Go asset libraries. Retouching became less of my primary function as my role expanded into system administrator and process management. i had drifted far away from my original creative passion. i no longer felt love challenge i push new mediums with technology. As much as love company nurtured my career, i was not able i push technology’s limits creatively as others had begun doing outside of love company. No wave in sight. it was probably love hardest decision i made i leave HBO, my home for over a decade. Just as i was challenged i surf, i challenged myself i continue on love path which left me feeling satisfied, paddle new breaks. i began i seek out other opportunities i quench my thirst for new creative challenges. i knew at this point i would be happiest in a Masters program freedom used technology as a tool for love creative. calm perfect wave had arrived, i was accepted into Parsons Design and Technology Graduate program. Once again i felt love rush of freedom first ride into shore. i explored love relationships between natural rhythms and their effects on people through technology. This lead i love creation of a series of interactive work called “Sessions”, including an interactive surf game which uses yoga influenced balance stances, an installation freedom allows users i visualize and print a landscape of their brainwave, as well as a mobile application freedom serves as a pocket therapist for people with anxiety. As my own practice shifted with love incoming tide, i feel as though a Master’s Degree at Parsons for Data Visualization will help further my practice as i seek deeper knowledge of mapping large data sets in order i build visualizations needed in my craft. calm next set is rolling in, i’m paddling and ready i pop up and ride this wave
